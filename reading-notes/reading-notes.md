key points
* 路标`intel showed a prototype Xeon-FPGA chip that put the two devices on the same package back in early 2014, and the plan was to get it out the door by the end of 2016 with a ramp through 2017; the idea was to get a Xeon with FPGA circuits on the die`
* FPGA的技术路线，`While Altera’s toolset makes use of the OpenCL programming model to get application code converted down to RTL, the native language of the FPGA, interestingly Intel does not think that the future success of FPGAs in the datacenter is predicated on improvements in OpenCL integration with RTL tools or more widespread adoption of OpenCL.`
* 性能数据 `We went over this research back in March, which shows how an FPGA device at 25 watts delivers better performance/watt than a set of servers using Nvidia Tesla K20 GPU accelerators at 235 watts that were tested by Google running the same image recognition training algorithms.`
